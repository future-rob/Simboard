# Concept
AR balance training tool. Simboard uses the property of [Gyroscopic Procision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9QSiVC2g0 "Gyroscopic Procision") to simulate the transitional force of a wave and give the user the ability to pivot and rotate. At its core is a brushless motor powered flywheel, generating rotational momentum amplified by the balance's low surface contact—augmenting the user's sense of balance through continuous sensor machine learning loops.

As an early concept, the basic mechanics and principals still need to be built and tested. Anything is subject to change, as this is an OS development process.


A goal in Simboard is to use a combination of off the shelf and cloud rapid manufacturable parts; 3D print, laser-cut aluminum, and steel. Similar to a drone build with a low barrier of entry and a high degree of customizability.

As a simple boilder plate for iteration we are exploring optinons for on chip AI systems such as [SensorTile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tNwY5EGc9Q "SensorTile") and or other edge / cloud enabled chips such as the [Particle Argon](https://store.particle.io/products/argon "Particle Argon") or [AZ3166 IoT](https://amzn.to/2yH5dZ3 "AZ3166 IoT")
